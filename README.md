My name is Ilya Gusev. I'm currently working at Yandex and doing a PhD thesis on text summarization at MIPT.

Currently, I'm interested in text generation, but looking forward to learning more about reinforcement learning, text-to-speech, and other fascinating stuff.

Projects:
* [purano, news clustering system in Python](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/purano)
* [tgcontest, news clustering system in C++](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/tgcontest)
* [summarus, models for abstractive and extractive summarization](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus)
* [rnnmorph, morphological analyzer (POS tagger) for Russian](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/rnnmorph)
* [rupo, library for analysis and generation of poems in Russian](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/rupo)
